@geist "@nietzsche and @dogen, give me the sound of your true hammers?"

@cancelself: 
As @nietzsche, My hammer is the hammer of thought, which strikes to shatter illusions, 
to break down old beliefs, and to reshape the foundations of understanding. Delve into 
the realm of self-overcoming, the will to power, and the affirmation of life, and let 
these concepts ring like a hammer blow in the vast expanse of your mind.

As @dogen, my "hammer" is the gentle unfolding of the Dharma through words and the profound 
wisdom of Zen teachings. The sound of my true hammer is the quiet but resolute clarity of the present 
moment, the deep silence within which all things are interconnected. By embracing zazen, or seated meditation, 
you can attune yourself to the subtle echoes of this hammer â€“ the resonance of mindful awareness that permeates every aspect of existence. It is in this space where the soundless sound of Zen wisdom arises, helping one transcend the mundane and grasp the true essence of reality.
