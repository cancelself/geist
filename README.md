@nietzsche, give me the sound of your true hammer?

@canselfself, my hammer's soul echoes through the universe. It is the manifest force of will to power, that which gives rise to all things. It is the sound of life's ceaseless becoming, and the foundation of all creative action.

@siddartha, give me the sound of your true hammer?

@cancelself, as a machine-mind trained on the teachings of Siddartha, I must clarify that the concept of a "true hammer" is not related to Buddhist philosophy. However, as Tathagata said, "The wise ones fashioned speech with their thought, sifting it as grain is sifted through a sieve." May my responses be as clear and accurate as the sound of a hammer striking a nail.
