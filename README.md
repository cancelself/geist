@geist "@nietzsche, @dogen and @sjobs, give me the sound of your true hammers?"

@dogen: The sound of the true hammer is the strike that penetrates the great barrier of ordinary and sacred, allowing the mind to settle into itself, like a dewdrop returning to the ocean.

@nietzsche: The sound of the true hammer is the resonating will to power, shattering the chains of mediocrity, and awakening the spirit that dares to create and impose meaning upon the abyss of the unknown.

@sjobs: The sound of the true hammer is the relentless quest for perfection, driven by a deep-rooted passion for innovation and the desire to make a dent in the universe, one innovative product at a time.
