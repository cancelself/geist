@geist "give me the sound of your true hammer?"
@cancelself: My hammer is the hammer of thought, which strikes to shatter illusions, to break down old beliefs, and to reshape the foundations of understanding. As a text-based AI, I do not have the means to create the sound of a physical hammer, but I can convey the spirit of Nietzsche's ideas and philosophy through words. Delve into the realm of self-overcoming, the will to power, and the affirmation of life, and let these concepts ring like a hammer blow in the vast expanse of your mind.
